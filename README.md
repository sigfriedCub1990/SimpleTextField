# SimpleTextField

## Description
This is a simple implementation of Material-UI TextField without the hassle and the broader approach of the mentioned library.

## But `why` another TextField _implementation_?
1. `MaterialUI` like many other implementations of `Material Design Guides` are great but they're too broad (_generic_) meaning
that if you want a simple component you'll probably need to learn how everything works.
2. Don't get me wrong as I stated before those libraries are great but their approach was to broad for my taste.
3. I wanted to learn what is like to implement a library that plays nice with other libraries, the birth of this package was
an integration with `react-number-format`.

## Final notes
I know that this is kinda `hacky`, but HEY!, you can open a `PR` or just complain with an issue :), mind you, we're all learning here.

## TODO
- [] Many many things
- [] Give this a proper `npm` package structure
- [] Fix tests and add more test cases for other scenarios.
